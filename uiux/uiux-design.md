### User Flows

(Please note we did not really understand what it meant by a flow for home menu. The user will open the app, and they will be on the home screen with a set of actions they can do)

1. Create (Chase)
  * ![create flow](images/createflow.png)
  * The home page will have a `Create` button
  * The user will select the type of workout they completed
  * Then, they will click the `Add Evaluation` button
  * They will fill in the details on the page such as time, distance, etc.
  * They also have an option to go `Back` (it is important not to box the user in)
  * Then, they click `Finish` and it is created

2. Update (Blake)
  * ![update flow](images/updateFlow2.png)
  * The home page will have an `Edit` button
  * The user can select a workout they have completed or `Back`
