# Interview Questions

Remember each team member needs to commit 3 questions & an individual interview.

## Chase
1. The last time you went on a run, what sort of statistics did you view for your run?
    * If there are: Where did you save these statistics
2. Tell me how you keep track of your runs currently? (they may not)
3. What is your most memorable run?
    * Follow up is: Do you have data stored about this run somewhere? If so, where?
