# Interview Questions

Remember each team member needs to commit 3 questions & an individual interview.

## Chase
1. If you were a runner, what sort of statistics would you want to be able to add/save for your run?
2. Do you think location should be included in the application or is that information you would be uncomfortable giving, even for an individual app?
3. What is the most important data metric to YOU when analyzing a run?

Comment from Tommy:
With these questions, you are asking about hypothetical situations instead of factual situations. I would consider rewording the questions to ask about actual occurances. An example would be:

1- Thinking back about the last time you went on a run, which statistics did you keep track off. 

Based on the answer you can then have a follow-up question: Did you save this data somewhere?

The user might answer: I wrote it down on a piece of paper, but I already lost it. 

That would be a good indicator of an user need (keeping track of the specific stat) and a pain point ( the data was lost due to the way it was recorded)
