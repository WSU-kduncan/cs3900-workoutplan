# Interview Questions

Remember each team member needs to commit 3 questions & an individual interview.

## Chase
1. The last time you went on a run, what sort of statistics did you view for your run?
    * If there are: Where did you save these statistics
2. Tell me how you keep track of your runs currently? (they may not)
3. What is your most memorable run?
    * Follow up is: Do you have data stored about this run somewhere? If so, where?



## Conor


## Blake
1. Do you enjoy social media?
    * If so, which apps/platforms do you use?
2. Do you enjoy talking about running or other workouts?
3. Would you like to meet more people who enjoy the same types of workouts you do and/or do them with these people?
