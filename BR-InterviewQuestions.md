# Interview Questions

Remember each team member needs to commit 3 questions & an individual interview.

## Chase
1. The last time you went on a run, what sort of statistics did you view for your run?
    * If there are: Where did you save these statistics
2. Tell me how you keep track of your runs currently? (they may not)
3. What is your most memorable run?
    * Follow up is: Do you have data stored about this run somewhere? If so, where?

Interview Question Results: About a month ago, he went on a run. He views time, distance, and pace. He has an application that has a server that saves everthing. He keeps track of his runs on the Under Amrour MapMyRun app. He is in ROTC, and his most memorable run was a memorial run he did in training. They were not allowed to have their phones or any electronics because the run had a deeper purpose.


## Conor


## Blake
1. Have/do you use any data storage/tracking programs/apps for anything?
    * If so, which apps/programs do you use?
2. Do you enjoy talking about running or other workouts and the specifics associated with them?
3. What is something logistically you would add/change with your runs/workouts?

Interview Question Results: I have used this really clunky online interface but it was really confusing and so I stopped using it after I stopped running cross country in high school because I didn't really like it. To answer the second question, I love talking abou my training with other runners. Having somewhere to document the specifics would be cool because there is so much data to remember and as time passes sometimes I forget everything. I just want an organized way of storing everything and being able to classify and identify runs.
