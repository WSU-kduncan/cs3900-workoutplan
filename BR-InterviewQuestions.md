# Interview Questions

Remember each team member needs to commit 3 questions & an individual interview.

## Chase
1. If you were a runner, what sort of statistics would you want to be able to add/save for your run?
2. Do you think location should be included in the application or is that information you would be uncomfortable giving, even for an individual app?
3. What is the most important data metric to YOU when analyzing a run?
