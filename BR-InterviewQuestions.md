# Interview Questions

Remember, each team member needs to commit 3 questions, and an individual interview.

## Chase
1. The last time you went on a run, what sort of statistics did you view for your run?
    * If there are: Where did you save these statistics
2. Tell me how you keep track of your runs currently? (they may not)
3. What is your most memorable run?
    * Follow up is: Do you have data stored about this run somewhere? If so, where?

Interview Question Results: About a month ago, he went on a run. He views time, distance, and pace. He has an application that has a server that saves everthing. He keeps track of his runs on the Under Amrour MapMyRun app. He is in ROTC, and his most memorable run was a memorial run he did in training. They were not allowed to have their phones or any electronics because the run had a deeper purpose.


## Connor
1. Do you keep track of your excercises?
 - If so, how do you do it?
> I use a combination of methods to keep track of my exercises. Sometimes, I just jot everything down in a notebook or a planner, which helps me stay organized. Other times, I use fitness apps on my phone that allow me to log workouts, set goals, and even track my progress over time.
2. What things do you keep track of for each excercise?
> I usually note down the exercises I do, the weights I lift, the number of sets and reps, and how I feel after each workout.
3. What is your favorite kind of excercise?
 - What do you like about it?
> I really enjoy a mix of exercises, but if I had to pick a favorite, it would probably be strength training. There's something really satisfying about lifting weights and seeing my progress in terms of strength and muscle definition. I also love incorporating some cardio, like running or cycling, to keep my endurance up.

## Blake
1. Have/do you use any data storage/tracking programs/apps for anything?
    * If so, which apps/programs do you use?
2. Do you enjoy talking about running or other workouts and the specifics associated with them?
3. What is something logistically you would add/change with your runs/workouts?

Interview Question Results: I have used this really clunky online interface but it was really confusing and so I stopped using it after I stopped running cross country in high school because I didn't really like it. To answer the second question, I love talking abou my training with other runners. Having somewhere to document the specifics would be cool because there is so much data to remember and as time passes sometimes I forget everything. I just want an organized way of storing everything and being able to classify and identify runs.
